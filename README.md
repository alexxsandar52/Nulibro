A libristo plugin which makes the website actually usable 

TODO: 

--  Make the cart better: not refresh the website every single time that you do anything with it. Want to remove an item? Click the X button and it removes it but    then also transports you to the cart interface which is annoying asf. Did you add something to your cart? Pop up interface which tells you it has been added with   recommendations and a little bar which says x until free shipping but it also does not update the cart widget in the corner. For that you have to refresh the   website to see it being added and see the new total which is annoying asf. Make the popup non existent and make it a little notification in the corner which says   something like 'Item added! X until free shipping'.

-- Remake the entire wishlist system currently the things lacking are:

  selecting multiple items at once
  
  changing anything without the website refreshing 50 times
  
  auto sorting the list by author,price,date or publisher
  
  a way to see availability, shipping time and price changes
  
  collapsing the list into other forms fxp no pictures, smaller picture sizes, horizontal or vertical listing

  addinng multiple items to the cart without it refreshing the entire website, hell even just one time refrehses the website, same with removing items from the wishlist

  
-- Add a dark theme 

-- Add multiple languages (German,French,Ukranian,Russian) 

-- Autocomplete delivery options and auto add it to the prices for books when your cart is empty ( shipping is flat 5 eur for every book so you only need to add the price to the first book).

-- Remove the 'Be x' thing because it is useless and takes up space

-- Add a sorty by price option (high or low) same with sort by author in general add a better search system which allows you to be more narrow. Something like blackwells.

-- Remake the shopping cart interface into something like this:
